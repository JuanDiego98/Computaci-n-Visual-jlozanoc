# Processing
In this program we draw a green ellipse and apply continuous translation, rotation and scaling transformations to it, using the sine function for the cyclical scaling and horizontal translation.

# Python
Here we use Matplotlib and NumPy to draw and transform a rectangle with translation, rotation and scaling operations through the use of homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices. We then save the animation of the process to a GIF file with imageio, pictured below.

# Unity
In this Unity project scene, we add a cube to it then transform it over time with the use of a simple C# script. The cube rotates constantly at a fixed rate while pulsating and teleporting a random distance in the X or Y axes.
